# Skin Disease Classification Using Deep Learning  

##  Overview  
This project aims to accurately classify various **skin diseases** from dermoscopic images using a **deep learning-based approach**.  
A **ResNet50** convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed as the feature extractor, combined with a **Cosine Annealing Learning Rate Scheduler with Warmup** to enhance model convergence and performance.  

The system supports the classification of **15 distinct skin conditions**, contributing to early and reliable disease detection that can assist medical professionals in diagnostic processes.

##  Training Strategy  

### Data Augmentation
To enhance generalization, the following augmentations were applied:
- Random rotations (¬±20¬∞)
- Width and height shifts (¬±10%)
- Shear and zoom transformations
- Horizontal flips  

### Learning Rate Scheduling  
A **Cosine Annealing Learning Rate Scheduler with Warmup** was implemented:  
- **Initial LR:** 1e-4  
- **Warmup Epochs:** 2  
- **Total Epochs:** 10  

This strategy enables a smooth learning rate transition, improving stability and convergence speed.
